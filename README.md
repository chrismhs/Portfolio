This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is this?

The portfolio of Chris Hastings-Spital.<br>
This is my first react project which I've made it public in the hopes that others may offer advice on how to improve.

### Current thoughts

I've decided to only provide case studies for 1 project from each of my previous 2 companies as I feel that these projects highlight my ability as a design in my current ability. I feel that older projects are not represenative of my current ways of working.

I debated adding a little more flair, but it's easy to go over the top and I wanted a simple foundation to experiment with at a later point. I'd rather keep it simple and get it out... it is my first website.

### Feedback

I would love to hear feedback and advice from anyone. Please don't hold back!
